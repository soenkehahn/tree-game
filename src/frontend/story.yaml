- goal: Me and my dog were walking through the park when he caught the scent of something and ran away into the bushes.
  options:
    - - "Me"
      - "You"
      - "They"
      - "Ancient Greece"
    - - "and my cat"
      - "and my pet ferret"
      - "and my mother"
      - "and my dog"
    - - "went on a roadtrip in the midwest"
      - "got into an accident."
      - "were walking through the park"
    - - "when I ran into my mother."
      - "when it started raining like crazy."
      - "when an ufo landed right in front of us."
      - "when he caught the scent of something"
    - - "that made him bark and hide behind my legs"
      - "and he started to sniff and sniff and wag his tail"
      - "and ran away into the bushes."
- goal: He found something in there and dragged it out. I didn't get a good look at it, since he was chewing on it, and when I reached him, he had swallowed it whole.
  options:
    - - He found something in there and dragged it out.
    - - I could see it perfectly,
      - It smelled like rotten flesh,
      - I didn't get a good look at it,
      - The dress fit perfectly,
    - - but I got a good look at it,
      - because mother is always right,
      - ever since the Trojan war,
      - since he was chewing on it,
    - - but after several attempts, I gave up.
      - and when I reached him, he had swallowed it whole.
      - and soon after, my cat started to purr.
      - but at least I still kept my dignity.
# But I could swear that it looked like a little person.
# I mean a little statue or something like that.
# I distinctly remember seeing weird little legs and I think also a face.
# In the following two weeks my dog developed lots of white spots
# all over his body.

# I went to the veterinarian and explained what had happened.
# I didn't want to sound like I was crazy,
# so I left out the part about the little statue in the park.
# Just said that my dog had developed white spots.
# That didn't help, the vet still looked at me like I was going insane.
# And with some hesitation in her voice, she said:
# "Those are black spots. Your dog is a Dalmation."

# Two weeks later, I walked my dog through the same park again.
# We passed by this small kiosk, selling newspapers and small bottles of water.
# And I saw they were also selling these gingerbread men.
# And then I finally got it:
# Two weeks ago my dog had found a gingerbread man.
# That someone must have dropped.
# Why my dog got white spots, I still don't know.
